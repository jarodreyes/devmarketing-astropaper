<p>
  We believe marketing is engineering, not art. We believe marketers should be engineers (at least at-heart), and marketing problems should be <b>solved like engineering problems</b>. When a developer runs into a problem, their first instinct is to time-box it and use a broad-swath of open-source tools and communities to creatively solve it as efficiently and frugally as possible. Marketing teams too often reach for expensive tools and out-of-date playbooks to work-around solvable problems.

DevMarketing was started by <b>engineer-turned-marketer Jarod Reyes</b> who built high-performing developer marketing teams at <b>Twilio, Auth0 and PlanetScale</b> before venturing out to help early-stage startups nail some of the early scaffolding necessary to achieve rapid and consistent growth. Book time today to solve some marketing problems.
