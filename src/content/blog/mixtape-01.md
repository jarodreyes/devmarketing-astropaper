# DevMarketing Mixtape[0]: Three Producers

I wanted to share some tunes with you all that I have been digging lately. Specifically there are three producers that I have been studying and getting to know. I love these producers because, though they are each hit makers, they use completely different techniques and styles to achieve a hit. Each of these producers tends to stay in the background while they let other performers and bands shine.

## Nigel Godrich

First up, we've got Nigel Godrich, often hailed as the "sixth member" of Radiohead. I think of Nigel as a Gandalf of the studio, conjuring up soundscapes that are as emotionally complex as they are technically sophisticated. Godrich is known for staying up all night playing with a combo of filters, pedals and synths to achieve a unique instrument of his own making; it's about sculpting songs into immersive experiences. His approach is a masterclass in balance, blending organic instrumentation with electronic elements in a way that feels both groundbreaking and timeless. Notice specifically how he never just "adds drums" but uses percussion in interesting ways. Lastly notice how he uses instrumentation sparingly, compared to Nile Rodgers who fills every moment to create a groove, Nigel instead lets space and evolution create movement.

## TOKiMONSTA

Then, we pivot to the beat mastery of TOKiMONSTA. Born and bred in the LA beat scene, she's the hacker in the group, bending genres and breaking rules to craft tracks that are utterly unique. Her style is a kaleidoscope of influences, from hip-hop to electronica to R&B, all mixed with a hefty dose of innovation. TOKiMONSTA elevates other musicians when she produces or remixes their tunes. Notice her unqique use of loops and vocal effects to create instrumentation outside of a traditional band.

## Nile Rodgers

Lastly, we slide into the glittering world of Nile Rodgers, the king of disco-funk guitar. Rodgers isn't just a producer; he's a hit-making machine whose riffs are so iconic, they instantly teleport you to a groovier era. His work with Chic, David Bowie, Madonna, and countless others is a testament to the power of rhythm, melody, and impeccable timing. Rodgers’ approach is all about that funky foundation—creating beats that are impossible not to move to. Notice how his beats are typically "4 on the floor" with a syncopated melody in the guitar parts (which he often overdubs multiple times to create intricate patterns). The last song of his on this playlist is one he co-produced with Daft Punk, but if you listen closely you will realize it is basically the most quintessential Nile Rodgers jam with some Daft Punk vocoders adding just a flare of their style.

So, there you have it—three producers, three radically different approaches, but one shared mission: to make music that moves, challenges, and transcends. If you're down to groove, dissect, and discuss how these legends engineer sonic masterpieces, [grab some time to chat](https://calendly.com/jarod-reyes) with me.
