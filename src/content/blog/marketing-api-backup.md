# Marketing API: Reference Documentation

## Overview

The Marketing API provides a frame of referenced meant to help leaders optimize marketing efforts for early-stage startups. This API-like approach to marketing utilizes familiar concepts from software engineering, applying them to marketing strategies and actions. Each 'endpoint' in this API corresponds to a key marketing function.

_Note: This is a living document. I will update the publish time as I add details and functions to the API. Todo: add key elements like benchmarks, budget and roles._

`Book time with DevMarketing to discuss these.`

Each endpoint in the Marketing API is designed to be seen as not just a function of the organization but also a methods of interacting between teams. As you scale your marketing teams you should look for ways to publicize the inputs and outputs of teams. The methods provide actionable steps for executing specific tasks, allowing for a data-driven, engineering-focused approach to marketing.
