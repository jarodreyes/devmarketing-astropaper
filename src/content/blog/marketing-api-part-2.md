# Marketing API: Connectivity between Marketing and external teams

One of the most critical pieces of the Marketing API is understanding how teams inside your company interact with marketing. In this section I will present the interactions of various marketing teams as inputs and outputs. This is meant to illustrate what a team needs from other teams, as well as what they are capable of delivering to other teams in a high-functioning organization.

What you will NOT see in outputs from these teams is the core responsibilities and functions of the teams. As an example, under Demand Generation you will not see **Create Campaigns** even though this is on of their core responsibilities that ultimately drives revenue for the company. Instead the Marketing API is about helping you better understand all of the critical unseen functions of high-performing marketing org within your company.

Marketing API Endpoints (teams / functions):

- Community & Devrel
