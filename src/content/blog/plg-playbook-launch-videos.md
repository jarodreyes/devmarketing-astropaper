# How we got 100,000 developers to care about a database feature launch

_Transforming Technical Features into Compelling Narratives_

In the world of product launches, particularly in the tech industry, the difference between a successful launch and a lackluster one often hinges on the story you tell. It's not just about the features; it's about the narrative around them. Today, I’d like to share how we transformed an ostensibly generic feature, like reverting schema changes, into a compelling story that captivated our target audience.

## Product-led Growth Requires Product-led Storytelling

At first glance, a feature like reverting schema changes may seem too technical or niche to excite a broader audience. However, when we were slating the launch week we knew this feature was the star. It was a massive step forward for databases, being able to quickly revert a bad database migration. It deserved a proper launch and storytelling has the power to elevate such features from mere technical specifications to solutions that solve real-world problems. It's about connecting the feature to a relatable context, illustrating its impact on the users' day-to-day tasks or broader business objectives.

## Crafting the Narrative: A Collaborative and Expert Approach

Creating an engaging narrative demands both expertise and a collaborative process. In developing a new narrative for our clients, I draw on my design school training, emphasizing the collection of diverse ideas, building consensus, and then distilling these into a cohesive final story. This approach ensures a dynamic creative process that incorporates a broad range of perspectives.

For this particular video, I collaborated for weeks with the product's engineers and stakeholders to draft the initial script. We focused on crafting a technically accurate story that would resonate with developers on an emotional level. The narrative we chose revolves around "Cami", a student programming a robot, "Ava", for her computer science final. The story vividly depicts Ava's development and Cami's growing attachment to her creation.

However, the turning point comes when Cami accidentally ships bad code, resulting in Ava's memory being wiped. This crisis spotlights the feature of reverting schema changes as not just a technical tool but as a crucial lifeline. In a world without this feature, the story would end in tragedy. But with Planetscale's innovative Rewind feature, hope is restored as Cami successfully reverts her changes, bringing Ava back to life. This narrative transformation effectively illustrates the feature's impact and its role as a problem-solving hero.

## Emotional Connection and Relatability: Key to Effective Storytelling

The effectiveness of our narrative approach lies in its universal relatability. Most developers can relate to the stress of looming deadlines, the fear of making errors, and the frustration of potentially redoing extensive work. By framing the feature as a solution to these common challenges, our story connects emotionally with the audience, offering a sense of relief and appreciation for a tool that simplifies their professional life.

Importantly, we chose a narrative that extends beyond a strictly professional context, even though our target audience consists of organizational developers. Technical product launches often fall into the trap of focusing too narrowly on specific use cases. However, to truly engage and grow an audience, it’s vital to craft narratives that resonate on an emotional level, capturing the audience's imagination and allowing them to see the potential applications in their own lives.

I can easily imagine using this feature to solve my professional problems, and I didn’t need you to spell it out for me. I just needed you to show me a compelling and emotionally true story that got me **excited** for your vision and your product.
